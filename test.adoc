= REST DSL in Action

This JBoss Fuse demo will demonstrate how the new Apache Camel REST DSL syntax can be used to expose REST Services that we will use to add, search or delete
articles for a blog into the Elasticsearch database. The use case has been enriched to expose also a file endpoint, as you can see within the following picture, which
is responsible to poll a folder, to consumes csv files and insert all the articles into the database. The Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is called from different routes
and will communicate with the ElasticSearch Database to perform the CRUD operations.
