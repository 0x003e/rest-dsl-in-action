# REST DSL in Action

This JBoss Fuse demo will demonstrate how the new Apache Camel REST DSL syntax can be used to expose REST Services that we will use to add, search or delete
articles for a blog into the Elasticsearch database. The use case has been enriched to expose also a file endpoint, as you can see within the following picture, which
is responsible to poll a folder, to consumes csv files and insert all the articles into the database. The Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is called from different routes
and will communicate with the ElasticSearch Database to perform the CRUD operations.

image::images/fuse-lab1.png[]

The Elasticsearch database and the Apache Camel projects will be deployed into different Fuse Managed Containers operated by a JBoss Fuse Fabric Server.

A kibana dashboard will be used to analyze the Blog articles published into the database

The CRUD services can be accessed using the new Camel REST component by performing HTTP requests (GET/PUT/DELETE) while the file component will also allow to do a bulk insert of blog articles.
To do this bulk import, you will create a CSV file containing this record structure `id,user,blog description,title` that you can define several times into the file.
All the records will be uploaded by the file endpoint, transformed using the `Apache Camel Bindy` Dataformat to a collection of Blog objects.
Next, each Blog object will be used as input to issue a request to insert a new record within the Elasticsearch database.

For the REST Service responsible to insert an article within the Elasticsearch database, a JSON article `{ "user": "cmoulliard" "postDate": "2015-12-12", "body": "Integration is hard.", "title": "On distributed search" }` message is issued against the REST endpoint `/blog/article/id` using a HTTP GET operation. 
The content of this HTTP request will be processed by an Apache Camel route as showed hereafter and transformed in order to access the elasticsearch component to call the Elasticsearch database. 

[source,java]
----
rest("/blog/").id("rest-blog-service").produces("application/json").consumes("application/json")
        
        .put("/article/{id}").id("rest-put-article").type(Blog.class)
            .to("direct:add");
            
JacksonDataFormat jacksondf = new JacksonDataFormat(Blog.class);

from("direct:add").id("add-direct-route")
        .log(LoggingLevel.INFO,"Add new Blog entry service called !")
        
        .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_NAME).simple("{{indexname}}")
        .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_TYPE).simple("{{indextype}}")
        .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_OPERATION).constant(ElasticsearchConfiguration.OPERATION_INDEX)

        // Transform Java Object to JSON
        .marshal(jacksondf)
        
        // Call the add service of the elasticsearchService POJO to generate the IndexRequest object
        .beanRef("elasticSearchService", "add")

        // Call the elasticsearch Service to add/insert an entry within the index
        .to("elasticsearch://{{clustername}}?ip={{address}}")
        
        // Response received and returned to the REST endpoint
        .log("Response received : ${body}");

# Prerequisites

- http://www.jboss.org/download-manager/file/jboss-fuse-6.2.0.GA-full_zip.zip[JBoss Fuse 6.2.GA]
- http://www.jboss.org/download-manager/file/jboss-devstudio-8.1.0.GA-standalone_jar.jar[JBoss Developer Studio]
- https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie[httpie]
- http://curl.haxx.se/download.html[curl] (optional)
- JDK 1.7
- Apache Maven 3.x

# Getting started

Follow these instructions to install and configure JBoss Developer Studio 8.1.0.GA and JBoss Fuse 6.2.GA - https://www.jboss.org/products/fuse/get-started/

# Installation

In order to use the demo, we have to realize these tasks which are described hereafter :

* https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/fuse-lab-emea-2015/archive/master.zip[Download] and compile the project locally
* Edit the hosts file to add an entry
* Download and install the JBoss Fuse Server
* Edit the etc/users.properties file of the server to define an admin user
* Create a Fuse Fabric Server and 2 child containers
* Deploy the Fabric project into the Fabric Server
* Play with the demo
* Run a Web Container to provide access to the Kibana dashboard
* Install, configure Apiman & Keycloak servers to secure the REST Services and provide service governance rule


## Compile Project 

. Open a Windows or Unix terminal. Unzip the material of the demo and move to that directory `fuse-demo-2015-master`
. Build your maven project locally
+
----
cd fuse-demo-2015-master
mvn clean install
----

## Edit Host file

. Edit the /etc/hosts file and add an entry to map the hostname `fusehost` with the IP address of the machine to be used. 
+
NOTE:  The value could be your local loopback address `127.0.0.1`, the Ethernet address assigned by the network card used (wifi, local network). The hostname is used by the ElasticSearch server to register the socket server when it is
started and also by the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component to access the server. Also, the Fuse Fabric Server will use it to assign an IP address to the socket server of the Apache
Zookeeper server.

## Install JBoss Fuse

. Download JBoss Fuse Server and unzip the archive file.
. Edit the `etc/user.properties` file that you will find under the home directory of `jboss-fuse-6.2.0.redhat-xxx` to uncomment the line containing the `admin` user. Save the file
. Open a second Windows or Unix terminal.
. Run this command `./bin/fuse` to launch the JBoss Fuse Server at the root of the JBoss Fuse installation directory

## Create a Fuse Fabric Server and 2 child containers

. Next, within the Fuse Karaf console, issue this shell command `shell:source mvn:com.redhat.gpe/fuse/1.0/script/install` ro run using the script a series of commands
+
[NOTE]
====
The shell script contains some Fabric subshell commands responsible to setup the Fabric server and two containers (elasticsearch-node and demo). The first child container will be used as Elasticsearch
database server and the demo Fuse managed container to run the Apache Camel Routes and expose the REST and File endpoints.

## Play with the demo

Open a third Windows or Unix Terminal and issue one of the following HTTP requests using curl or httpie tool within the demo project folder

### Add a user

NOTE : Before to issue the HTTP GET request, you can change the content of the Blog Article that you will publish

    http PUT http://fusehost:9191/blog/article/1 < data/elasticsearch/entry.json

### Search a user

    http http://fusehost:9191/blog/article/search/user/cmoulliard

### Search a user using its ID

    http http://fusehost:9191/blog/article/search/user/1

### Delete a user

    http DELETE http://fusehost:9191/blog/article/1
    
### Bul import

In order to perform a buk import of articles within the ElasticSearch database, we will copy/paste the records.csv file from the $DEMO_DIRECTORY/camel/src/data` directory to the `articles` directory created under the local instance demo`

. Create the FUSE_HOME` ENV variable to point to the home directory of the installation directory of JBoss Fuse

    export FUSE_HOME=/Users/chmoulli/Fuse/Fuse-servers/jboss-fuse-6.2.0.redhat-133

. Create the `DEMO_DIRECTORY` ENV variable to point to the folder containing the demo project

    export DEMO_DIRECTORY=/Users/chmoulli/RedHat/GPE/GPE-Courses/fuse-demo/
    
. Copy the file 
----    
cp $LAB_DIRECTORY/camel/src/data/articles/records.csv $FUSE_HOME/instances/demo/articles/

## Use Kibana dashboard

The data inserted into the Elasticsearch Database can be analyzed using the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana[Kibana] dashboard.
The dashboard is designed around modern HTML5 Web technologies and can be run locally with a Web Container.
This lab provides a jetty maven goal that we will launch in order to start a local HTTP Server that we can access from the browser
at this address `ttp://localhost:9090/kibana3/index.html`

To start locally the HTTP Server, open a Windows or unix terminal and move to the home directory of the project containing the code. Switch to the folder
`kibana` and run this command.

When the server is launched, open your browser at the address `ttp://localhost:9090/kibana3/index.html`. The first time, that you will connect to the Dashboard, the index HTML
page will display general content about How to create a dashboard and importing the data from the Elasticsearch Database.

image::images/dashboard1.png[]

For the purpose of this lab, we have prepare a dashboard which is already configured with the panels and the type fields that we would like to
display graphically using a histogram and list panels.

In order to add the JSON dashboard document definition to the Elasticsearch server within th `kibana-int` index, you will issue a HTTP request at the root of the `fuse-lab` project.
This HTTP request calls a REST service of the Elasticsearch server to insert the `fuse-lab` dashboard type using the `dashboard.json` file as input.

----
http PUT http://fusehost:9200/kibana-int/dashboard/fuselab < data/elasticsearch/dashboard.json
----

Next, you can refresh your index.html page within your browser and select the load button from the top menu bar in order to load the `fuse-lab` dashboard.

image::images/dashboard2.png[]

The fuse-lab dashboard contain our panels without any data as we haven't yet populated the database with records

image::images/dashboard3.png[]

So run the `mvn camel:run` maven goal under the camel project of the directory fuse-lab` to start a local CamelContext.

This context will instantiates the different beans and will start the file and REST endpoints. Then the content of the file `records.csv` located under `camel/src/data/articles` directory will be processed by the file component and injected into the the Elasticsearch database according to the following Apache
Camel Route definition.

The content of the file is transformed using the `Apache Camel Bindy` component and mapped to a list of Blog objects.

Next, the list is splitted and each Blog object will be send to the `direct:add` endpoint. This endpoint is a service/facade responsible to call the elasticsearch endpoint to add an entry within the `blog` index.

[source,java]
----
from("{{fileUri}}")
    .log(LoggingLevel.DEBUG,"Records received : ${body}")
    .unmarshal(csv)
    .split(body())
        .setHeader("id").simple("${body.id}")
        .to("direct:add");
        
JacksonDataFormat jacksondf = new JacksonDataFormat(Blog.class);

from("direct:add").id("add-direct-route")
    .log(LoggingLevel.INFO,"Add new Blog entry service called !")

    .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_NAME).simple("{{indexname}}")
    .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_TYPE).simple("{{indextype}}")
    .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_OPERATION).constant(ElasticsearchConfiguration.OPERATION_INDEX)

    // Transform Java Object to JSON
    .marshal(jacksondf)

    // Call the add service of the elasticsearchService POJO to generate the IndexRequest object
    .beanRef("elasticSearchService", "add")

    // Call the elasticsearch Service to add/insert an entry within the index
    .to("elasticsearch://{{clustername}}?ip={{address}}")
    .log("Response received : ${body}");
----

Within your browser, refresh your dashboard and you will see the data.

# Minimal installation

You can also run the project locally using `mvn camel:run` at the condition that the Karaf feature `insight-elasticsearch` has been deployed into JBoss Fuse 6.2.
Additional OSGI parameters could be defined for the elasticsearch database using the `io.fabric8.elasticsearch-insight.cfg` file deployed into the `etc` folder of JBoss Fuse.
That should also work if you deploy locally an Elasticsearch instance but this feature hasn't been tested.


# All HTTPie requests

When you test your project, you can copy/paste this list of HTTPie queries to play with the CRUD scenario
It will delete the blog index, create a new index, insert 3 articles, search for user or base on id and will delete
 the user id = 1

# Replay

If, for any reason, you would like to restart the demo from the beginning. Then, exist from the JBoss Fuse Console using the command `CTRL-D` or `osgi:shutdown`
command and run this script `./bin/deletefabric8`. It will kill the jvm instances and delete the instances and some sub-folders defined.
under the data folder.

# Troubleshooting

- When the local Camel REST endpoints don't work, you can query directly the elasticsearch database using these HTTPie requests to check if it work.

  Remark : The hostname must be changed depending if you run locally or remotely the JBoss Fuse Server
