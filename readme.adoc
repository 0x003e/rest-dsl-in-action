# GPE JBoss Fuse Lab

This JBoss Fuse lab will demonstrate how the new Apache Camel REST DSL syntax can be used to design a CRUD service.
An Elasticsearch NoSQL database will be deployed into a Fuse Managed Container and the database will be populate with Blog JSon documents.
The CRUD service will allow to add, delete or search for articles published. The search function allow to retrieve a user using its id, name.

The CRUD services can be accessed using the new Camel REST component and the file component. To do a bulk import of articles, you will create a CSV file containing this
record structure `id,user,blog description,title`. All the records will be uploaded by the file endpoint, transformed using the `Apache Camel Bindy` Dataformat to a collection of Blog objects.
Next, each Blog object will be used as input to issue a request to insert a new record within the Elasticsearch database.

For the REST Service, a JSON article `{ "user": "cmoulliard" "postDate": "2015-12-12", "body": "Integration is hard.", "title": "On distributed search" }` message is expected by the Jetty REST endpoint `/blog/article/id`
The body content will be used as input to also issue a request to the same Service used by the file endpoint to consume CSV records..

- http://www.jboss.org/download-manager/file/jboss-fuse-6.2.0.GA-full_zip.zip[JBoss Fuse 6.2.GA]
- http://www.jboss.org/download-manager/file/jboss-devstudio-8.1.0.GA-standalone_jar.jar[JBoss Developer Studio]
- https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie[httpie]
- http://curl.haxx.se/download.html[curl] (optional)
- JDK 1.7
- Apache Maven 3.x

# Getting started

Follow these instructions to install and configure JBoss Developer Studio 8.1.0.GA and JBoss Fuse 6.2.GA - https://www.jboss.org/products/fuse/get-started/

# Installation

In order to use the lab, we have to perform these steps :

 - https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/fuse-lab-emea-2015/archive/master.zip[Download] and compile the project locally
 - Create a Fuse Fabric Server
 - Create 2 child containers; one will be used as the Elasticsearch Database and the other for the project itself where the Apache Camel Routes will be deployed.

Open a Windows or Unix terminal. Unzip the material of the and move to that directory `fuse-lab-emea-2015-master`

Build your maven project locally and deploy it to the JBoss Fuse Fabric Server

```
cd fuse-lab-emea-2015-master
mvn clean install
```

Open a second Windows or Unix Terminal and move to the installation directory of the JBoss Fuse 6.2 - GA distribution directory.

Edit the `etc/user.properties` file to uncomment the line containing the `dmin` user. Save the file

Run this command `./bin/fuse` to launch first the JBoss Fuse Server and next within the Fuse Karaf console, issue the shell command `shell:source mvn:com.redhat.gpe/fuse-lab/1.0/script/creation` responsible to setup the Fabric
server and the 2 containers.

	Container: lab.
````

After a few moments, the environment will be ready. You can verify/control that the 2 containers are running

```
JBossFuse:karaf@root>fabric:container-list
[id]                 [version]  [type]  [connected]  [profiles]                       [provision status]
root*                 1.0        karaf   yes          fabric                           success
                                                      fabric-ensemble-0000-1
                                                      jboss-fuse-full
  elasticsearch-node  1.0        karaf   yes          insight-elasticsearch.datastore  success
  lab                 1.0        karaf   yes          feature-camel                    success
```

Now that the profile has been created and published on JBoss Fuse, we will install it into the Fuse Lab Managed container

```
JBosFuse:karaf@root>fabric:container-add-profile lab gpe-fuse
```

Remarks :

If you change th code of this lab, then redeploy if after doing a maven installation and running this command `mvn fabric8:deploy`.
Next, the profile can updated on the container using theses commands

```
fabric:container-remove-profile lab gpe-fuse
fabric:container-add-profile lab gpe-fuse
```

If, for any reason, you would like to restart the lab from the beginning. Then, exist from the JBoss Fuse Console using the command `CTRL-D` or `osgi:shutdown`
and run this script to clean and kill the jvm instances `./bin/deletefabric8`

# Minimal installation

You can also run the project locally using `mvn camel:run` at the condition that the Karaf feature `insight-elasticsearch` has been deployed into JBoss Fuse 6.2.
Additional OSGI parameters could be defined forthe elasticsearch database using the `io.fabric8.elasticsearch-insight.cfg` file deployed into the `etc` folder of JBoss Fuse.
That should also work if you deploy locally an Elasticsearch instance but this feature hasn't been tested.

# Play with the lab

Open a Windows or Unix Terminal and issue one of the following HTTP requests using curl or httpie tool within the lab project folder

## Add a user

Before to issue the HTTP GET request, you can change the content of the Blog Article that you will publish

````
http PUT http://127.0.0.1:9191/blog/article/1 < data/elasticsearch/entry.json
````

## Search a user

````
http http://127.0.0.1:9191/blog/article/search/user/cmoulliard
````

## Search a user using its ID

````
http http://127.0.0.1:9191/blog/article/search/d/1
````

## Delete a user

````
http DELETE http://127.0.0.1:9191/blog/article/1
````

## All HTTPie requests

When you test your project, you can copy/paste this list of HTTPie queries to play with the CRUD scenario

```
http PUT http://127.0.0.1:9191/blog/article/1 < data/elasticsearch/entry.json
http PUT http://127.0.0.1:9191/blog/article/2 < data/elasticsearch/entry.json

# Dashboard

The data inserted into the Elasticsearch Database can be analyzed using the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana[Kibana] dashboard.
The dashboard is designed around modern HTML5 Web technologies and can be run locally with a Web Container.
This lab provides a jetty maven goal that we will launch in order to start a local HTTP Server that we can access from the browser
at this address `ttp://localhost:9090/kibana3/index.html`

To start locally the HTTP Server, open a Windows or unix terminal and move to the home directory of the project containing the code. Switch to the folder
kibana` and run this command.

```
mvn jetty:run

```

When the server is launched, open your browser at the address `ttp://localhost:9090/kibana3/index.html`. The first time, that you will connect to the Dashboard, the index HTML
page will display general content about How to create a dashboard and importing the data from the Elasticsearch Database.

image::images/dashboard1.png[]

For the purpose of this lab, we have prepare a dashboard which is already configured with the panels and the type fields that we would like to
display graphically using a histogram and list panels.

In order to add the JSON dashboard document definition to the Elasticsearch server within th `kibana-int` index, you will issue a HTTP request at the root of the `fuse-lab` project.
This HTTP request calls a REST service of the Elasticsearch server to insert the `fuse-lab` dashboard type using the `dashboard.json` file as input.

```
http PUT http://fusehost:9200/kibana-int/dashboard/fuselab < data/elasticsearch/dashboard.json
```

Next, you can refresh your index.html page within your browser and select the load button from the top menu bar in order to load the `fuse-lab` dashboard.

image::images/dashboard2.png[]

The fuse-lab dashboard contain our panels without any data as we haven't yet populated the database with records

image::images/dashboard3.png[]

So run the `mvn camel:run` maven goal under the camel project of the directory fuse-lab` to start a local CamelContext.

This context will instantiates the different beans and will start the file and REST endpoints. Then the content of the file `records.csv` located under `camel/src/data/articles` directory will be processed by the file component and injected into the the Elasticsearch database according to the following Apache
Camel Route definition.

The content of the file is transformed using the `Apache Camel Bindy` component and mapped to a list of Blog objects.

Next, the list is splitted and each Blog object will be send to the `direct:add` endpoint. This endpoint is a service/facade responsible to call the elasticsearch endpoint to add an entry within the `blog` index.

[source,java]
----
from("{{fileUri}}")
    .log(LoggingLevel.DEBUG,"Records received : ${body}")
    .unmarshal(csv)
    .split(body())
        .setHeader("id").simple("${body.id}")
        .to("direct:add");
        
JacksonDataFormat jacksondf = new JacksonDataFormat(Blog.class);

from("direct:add").id("add-direct-route")
    .log(LoggingLevel.INFO,"Add new Blog entry service called !")

    .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_NAME).simple("{{indexname}}")
    .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_TYPE).simple("{{indextype}}")
    .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_OPERATION).constant(ElasticsearchConfiguration.OPERATION_INDEX)

    // Transform Java Object to JSON
    .marshal(jacksondf)

    // Call the add service of the elasticsearchService POJO to generate the IndexRequest object
    .beanRef("elasticSearchService", "add")

    // Call the elasticsearch Service to add/insert an entry within the index
    .to("elasticsearch://{{clustername}}?ip={{address}}")
    .log("Response received : ${body}");
----

Within your browser, refresh your dashboard and you will see the data.

## Install cmd to deploy the Kibana3 war

```
Without Fabric

features:install war
install -s webbundle:mvn:com.redhat.gpe/kibana/1.0/war?Web-ContextPath=/kibana3

Does not work with Fabric & Fuse 6.2 - https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ENTESB-2831[see ENTESB-2831]
```

## Create kibana_index, add dashboard & search about it


- Delete and recreate kibana-int index

  ```
  http DELETE http://fusehost:9200/kibana-int
  http PUT http://fusehost:9200/kibana-int
  ```
- Add fuse-lab dashboard

  ```
  http PUT http://fusehost:9200/kibana-int/dashboard/fuse-lab < data/elasticsearch/dashboard.json
  ```
- Delete dashboard

  ```
  http DELETE http://fusehost:9200/kibana-int/dashboard/fuse-lab
  ```
- Export existing kibana dashboard from ES to a file

  ```
  http http://fusehost:9200/kibana-int/dashboard/fuse-lab/_source > fuse-lab.json
  ```
- Get Dashboards

  ```
  http http://fusehost:9200/_search q=="dashboard:*"
  http http://fusehost:9200/kibana-int/_search q=="title:fuse-lab" pretty==true
  ```

## Backup and restore

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.3/modules-snapshots.html
http:/chrissimpson.co.uk/elasticsearch-snapshot-restore-api.html


## Troubleshooting

- When the local Camel REST endpoints don't work, you can query directly the elasticsearch database using these HTTPie requests to check if it work.

  Remark : The hostname must be changed depending if you run locally or remotely the JBoss Fuse Server

  ```
  http http://127.0.0.1:9191/blog/post/1 pretty==true
  http http://fusehost:9200/blog/post/_search q=="user:cmoulliard" pretty==true

  curl 'http://fusehost:9200/blog/post/_search?q=user:cmoulliard&pretty=true'
  ```

- Delete all articles

  http DELETE http://fusehost:9200/blog/post/_query q=="user:*"

- Delete Index

  http DELETE http://fusehost:9200/blog

- Create Index

  http PUT http://fusehost:9200/blog

- Add mapping

  http PUT http://fusehost:9200/blog/_mapping/article < data/elasticsearch/mapping.json

- Check mapping

  http http://fusehost:9200/blog/_mapping/article

- Add user

  http PUT http://fusehost:9200/blog/article/1 < camel/data/elasticsearch/entry.json

- Query

  http http://fusehost:9200/blog/post/_search pretty==true < camel/data/elasticsearch/query.json

- All together
