# REST DSL in Action

This JBoss Fuse demo will demonstrate how the new Apache Camel REST DSL syntax can be used to expose REST Services that we will use to add, search or delete
articles for a blog into the Elasticsearch database. The use case has been enriched to expose also a file endpoint, as you can see within the following picture, which
is responsible to poll a folder, to consumes csv files and insert all the articles into the database. The Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is called from different routes
and will communicate with the ElasticSearch Database to perform the CRUD operations.

image::images/fuse-lab1.png[]

The Elasticsearch database and the Apache Camel projects will be deployed into different Fuse Managed Containers operated by a JBoss Fuse Fabric Server.

A kibana dashboard will be used to analyze the Blog articles published into the database

The CRUD services can be accessed using the new Camel REST component by performing HTTP requests (GET/PUT/DELETE) while the file component will also allow to do a bulk insert of blog articles.

By example, to use the REST Service responsible to insert an article within the Elasticsearch database, a JSON article `{ "user": "cmoulliard" "postDate": "2015-12-12", "body": "Integration is hard.", "title": "On distributed search" }` message is issued against the REST endpoint `/blog/article/id` using a HTTP GET operation. 
The content of this HTTP request will be processed by an Apache Camel route as showed hereafter and transformed in order to access the elasticsearch component to call the Elasticsearch database. 

[source,java]
----
rest("/blog/").id("rest-blog-service").produces("application/json").consumes("application/json")
        
        .put("/article/{id}").id("rest-put-article").type(Blog.class)
            .to("direct:add");
            
JacksonDataFormat jacksondf = new JacksonDataFormat(Blog.class);

from("direct:add").id("add-direct-route")
        .log(LoggingLevel.INFO,"Add new Blog entry service called !")
        
        .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_NAME).simple("{{indexname}}")
        .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_TYPE).simple("{{indextype}}")
        .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_OPERATION).constant(ElasticsearchConfiguration.OPERATION_INDEX)

        // Transform Java Object to JSON
        .marshal(jacksondf)
        
        // Call the add service of the elasticsearchService POJO to generate the IndexRequest object
        .beanRef("elasticSearchService", "add")

        // Call the elasticsearch Service to add/insert an entry within the index
        .to("elasticsearch://{{clustername}}?ip={{address}}")
        
        // Response received and returned to the REST endpoint
        .log("Response received : ${body}");            
----

The following table summaries the Routes used, REST Services exposed and the Bean Methods called like the Object type used to call the ElasticSearch database

|====
| Rest URl | Operation | Route | Bean method | ElasticSearch Class Type
| /blog/article/ | PUT | AddArticleToElasticRoute | ElasticSearchService.add() | IndexRequest
| blog/article/search/user/{user} | GET | SearchArticleToElasticRoute | ElasticSearchService.getBlog() | GetResponse
| blog/article/search/id/{id} | GET | SearchArticleToElasticRoute | ElasticSearchService.getBlogs() | SearchResponse
| blog/article/{id} | DELETE | DeleteArticleToElasticRoute | ElasticSearchService.() | DeleteRequest
|====

To do this bulk import, you will create a CSV file containing this record structure `id,user,blog description,title` that you can define several times into the file.
All the records will be uploaded by the file endpoint, transformed using the `Apache Camel Bindy` Dataformat to a collection of Blog objects.
Next, each Blog object will be used as input object to issue a request to insert a new record within the Elasticsearch database using the Bean ElasticSearch.

[source,java]
----
from("{{fileUri}}")
    .log(LoggingLevel.DEBUG,"Records received : ${body}")
    .unmarshal(csv)
    .split(body())
        .setHeader("id").simple("${body.id}")
        .to("direct:add");
        
JacksonDataFormat jacksondf = new JacksonDataFormat(Blog.class);

from("direct:add").id("add-direct-route")
    .log(LoggingLevel.INFO,"Add new Blog entry service called !")

    .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_NAME).simple("{{indexname}}")
    .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_TYPE).simple("{{indextype}}")
    .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_OPERATION).constant(ElasticsearchConfiguration.OPERATION_INDEX)

    // Transform Java Object to JSON
    .marshal(jacksondf)

    // Call the add service of the elasticsearchService POJO to generate the IndexRequest object
    .beanRef("elasticSearchService", "add")

    // Call the elasticsearch Service to add/insert an entry within the index
    .to("elasticsearch://{{clustername}}?ip={{address}}")
    .log("Response received : ${body}");

# Prerequisites

- http://www.jboss.org/download-manager/file/jboss-fuse-6.2.0.GA-full_zip.zip[JBoss Fuse 6.2.GA]
- http://www.jboss.org/download-manager/file/jboss-devstudio-8.1.0.GA-standalone_jar.jar[JBoss Developer Studio]
- https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie[httpie]
- http://curl.haxx.se/download.html[curl] (optional)
- JDK 1.7
- Apache Maven 3.x

# Getting started

Follow these instructions to install and configure JBoss Developer Studio 8.1.0.GA and JBoss Fuse 6.2.GA - https://www.jboss.org/products/fuse/get-started/

# Installation

In order to use the demo, we have to realize these tasks which are described hereafter :

* https://github.com/FuseByExample/rest-dsl-in-action/archive/master.zip[Download] and compile the project locally
* Edit the hosts file to add an entry
* Download and install the JBoss Fuse Server
* Edit the etc/users.properties file of the server to define an admin user
* Create a Fuse Fabric Server and 2 child containers
* Deploy the Fabric project into the Fabric Server
* Run a Web Container to provide access to the Kibana dashboard
* Play with the demo
* Install, configure Apiman & Keycloak servers to secure the REST Services and provide service governance rule

## Compile Project 

. Open a Windows or Unix terminal. Unzip the material of the demo and move to that directory `rest-dsl-in-action-master`
. Build your maven project locally
+
----
cd rest-dsl-in-action-master
mvn clean install
----

## Edit Host file

. Edit the /etc/hosts file and add an entry to map the hostname `localhost` with the IP address of the machine to be used.
+
NOTE:  The value could be your local loopback address `127.0.0.1` when NOT connected to a network, otherwise, the Ethernet address assigned by the network card used (wifi, local network). The hostname is used by the ElasticSearch server to register the socket server when it is
started and also by the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component to access the server. Also, the Fuse Fabric Server will use it to assign an IP address to the socket server of the Apache
Zookeeper server.

## Install JBoss Fuse

. Download JBoss Fuse Server and unzip the archive file.
. Edit the `etc/user.properties` file that you will find under the home directory of `jboss-fuse-6.2.0.redhat-xxx` to uncomment the line containing the `admin` user. Save the file
. Open a second Windows or Unix terminal.
. Run this command `./bin/fuse` to launch the JBoss Fuse Server at the root of the JBoss Fuse installation directory

## Create a Fuse Fabric Server and 2 child containers

. Next, within the Fuse Karaf console, issue this shell command `shell:source mvn:org.jboss.fuse/deployment/1.0/script/install` ro run using the script a series of commands
+
[NOTE]
====
The shell script contains some Fabric subshell commands responsible to setup the Fabric server and two containers (elasticsearch-node and demo). The first child container will be used as Elasticsearch
database server and the demo Fuse managed container to run the Apache Camel Routes and expose the REST and File endpoints.

## Define Elasticsearch Data Mapping

In order to collect the data using the ElasticSearch No SQL database, we will first create an Index with the name `Blog` and the type `article`.
Next, we will define the mapping of the fields and their type of a Blog Article and how ElasticSearch will manage them from JSon documents
+
----
{
  "article": {
    "properties": {
      "user": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "title": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "postDate": {
        "type": "date",
        "format": "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm"
      },
      "body": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "id": {
        "type": "integer"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
+
. Run these commands within the terminal of the project in order to access the HTTP Server of Elasticsearch and configure the Index and the type
----
http PUT http://localhost:9200/blog
http PUT http://localhost:9200/blog/_mapping/article < data/elasticsearch/mapping.json
http http://localhost:9200/blog/_mapping/article

curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/blog
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/blog/_mapping/article -d @data/elasticsearch/mapping.json
curl http://localhost:9200/blog/_mapping/article
----
+
NOTE: The first command creates the index, the second creates the mapping and the last collect from ES the mapping created.

## Use Kibana dashboard

The data inserted into the Elasticsearch Database can be analyzed using the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana[Kibana] dashboard.
The dashboard is designed around modern HTML5 Web technologies and can be run locally with a Web Container.
This demo provides a jetty maven goal that we will launch in order to start a local HTTP Server that we can access from the browser
at this address `http://localhost:9090/kibana3/index.html`

. To start locally the HTTP Server, open a Windows or unix terminal and move to the home directory of the project containing the code.
. Switch to the folder `kibana` and run this maven command `mvn jetty:run`.

### Bulk import

In order to perform a buk import of articles within the ElasticSearch database, we will copy/paste the records.csv file from the `$DEMO_DIRECTORY/camel/src/data` directory to the `articles` directory created under the local instance `demo`.

. Create the `FUSE_HOME` ENV variable to point to the home directory of the installation directory of JBoss Fuse

    export FUSE_HOME=/Users/chmoulli/Fuse/Fuse-servers/jboss-fuse-6.2.0.redhat-133

. Create the `DEMO_DIRECTORY` ENV variable to point to the folder containing the demo project

    export DEMO_DIRECTORY=/Users/chmoulli/Downloads/rest-dsl-in-action-master
    
. Copy the file 
+
----    
cp $DEMO_DIRECTORY/routing/src/data/articles/records.csv $FUSE_HOME/instances/demo/articles/
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `articles` directory folder is scanned by the Apache Camel rote `FileToAddServiceRoute`
====
+
. Within your browser, refresh your dashboard and you will see the data.

.Demo dashboard with articles
image::images/dashboard4.png[]

## Swagger documentation (optional)

For the purpose of this demo, we have documented the REST Services using the http://swagger.io/[Swagger API]. The documentation is defined within the `swagger/srcmain/resources/services.json` file of the swagger maven module.
The file has been produced manually as camel-swagger component 2.15 packaged within JBoss Fuse 6.2 doesn't parse yet the REST DSL syntax to generate it. This feature should be available
for the next release of JBoss Fuse.

To access the documentation and run the queries against the service, here are the instruction to follow

. Open a terminal within the `swagger` maven module

    cd swagger

. Launch the script +./run_jetty.sh+ to build the project locally and start a jetty instance with Swagger UI

    ./run_jetty.sh
    
. When the jetty instance is started, open your browser at this address
   
   http://localhost:8000/?url=services.json
   
. You can now add a user by clicking on the service `Add a new Blog Article`.
. To select the user data, just click on the Model schema and the field (left part of the service `Add a new Blog Article` will be populated.
. Change the data to be used
+
----
{
  "id": "21",
  "user": "cmoulliard",
  "body": "This is a blog article",
  "title": "Title of the blog article",
  "postDate": "2015-10-03T10:10"
}
----
. Click on `try it out!` button
+
image::images/swagger1.png[]
+
. Search for a user using the service `Blog Search Id operation` and fill the parameter with the id `21`
+
image::images/swagger2.png[]
+   
. Review the results using the `Kibana` dashboard and search for the id which is equal to `21`
+
image::images/swagger3.png[]

## Security governance with Apiman & Keycloak

During the first part of the demo, we have deployed the Apache Camel Routes exposing the REST services to create, search or delete a user into a JBoss Fuse Karaf container
and installed also an Elasticsearch server to collect the data from the different REST Services. Now, within the next section of the demo, we will
use the ApiMan & Keycloak projects to secure our endpoints in order to authenticate the incoming HTTP request using Basic Authentication but also OAuth2 to authorize the access
to the service based on the role provided.

The instructions required to install the server and to configure them are described hereafter :

. Download [WildFly](http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/8.2.0.Final/wildfly-8.2.0.Final.zip) & [Apiman 1.1.7.Final overlay for WildFly 8.2](http://downloads.jboss.org/apiman/1.1.7.Final/apiman-distro-wildfly8-1.1.7.Final-overlay.zip)
. Unpack the `WildFly 8.2 zip`
. Unpack the`apiman 1.1.7.Final WildFly 8 overlay zip` inside the wildfly directory
. Start WildFly 8 using the `standalone-apiman.xml` configuration file
. Point your browser at the apiman UI and login using `admin` as user and `admin123!` as password
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use this list of instructions to download and install Apiman locally

====

Now that our Apiman server has been launched, we will create an organization to manage the different services that we would like to secure using the following security policies; Basic Authentication, OAuth & Limit rates.

. Open your web browser at this address `http://localhost:8080/apimanui/` and encode `admin` for the username and `admin123!` as password to access the application.
+
image::images/apiman-login.png[]
+
. If the authentication succeeds, then you will be redirected to the `Api Management screen`
+
image::images/apiman-management.png[]
+
. Click on the link Create a New Organization` and encode `Fuse` as organization name within the field `Organization Name` of the new screen displayed.
. Next, click on the `Create Organisation` button.
+
image::images/apiman-organization.png[]
+
. The Web UI is refreshed and a new organization called `Fuse` is displayed under the `Home` screen
+
image::images/apiman-fuse-organisation.png[]
+
. Click on the `Service` Tab of the `Fuse` organization to register the REST Service that we will manage
+
NOTE: As we will not define different SLA (e.g. quotas, ...) to manage the service, No http://www.apiman.io/latest/user-guide.html#_plans[plan] will be defined for the demo
+
image::images/apiman-fuse-organisation-service.png[]

## Use case - Direct forward

The first use case that we will deal with is very simple and can be compared to a proxy forwarding scenario where the incoming request is matched to a service
and next forwarded to the real endpoint exposing the REST service. To design it, we will create a service, specify the address of the service and publish the service in order to let APiMan Gateway to
accept the HTTP requests.

. Click on the button `New Service` of this screen.
. Within `New Service` screen, add `blog-service` as Service Name and provide a `description` to mention that this service
  is not secured "Insecure service. No authentication will be required to access the service". When done, click on the Create Service` button
+
image::images/apiman-fuse-organisation-addservice.png[]
+
. You will be redirected to the `blog-service`, version `1.0` screen where we will add the URL of the REST Service exposed by the Apache Camel REST DSL
  and specify that the service is http://www.apiman.io/latest/user-guide.html#_services[public].
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice.png[]
+
. Click on the `implementation` link and add the Api endpoint `http://localhost:9191/blog/article`, select `REST` from the `Api Type` dropdown box. The API endpoint corresponds to our REST Service path as defined within the REST DSL `blog/article`.
. Click on the `Save` button
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-api.png[]
+ 
. From the `blog-service` screen, select the `Plans` and click within the checkbox `Make this service public` as we haven't defined any plans.
. Save the service definition by clicking again on the `save` button.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-plans.png[]
+
. Our service is ready and we will publish it. 
+
NOTE: When a service is published, then the Api endpoint will become available and the Api Gateway will be able to process HTTP requests addressed to this service.
+
. Click on the `Publish` button of the `blog-service` screen.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-publish.png[]
+
NOTE: The screen is refreshed and additional information appears under the list like `Contracts, Endpoint, Activity, Metrics`
+
. Click on `Endpoint` to see the URL address of the endpoint exposed by the Api Gateway and select it
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-unsecure-endpoint.png[]
+
. Use one of the existing opened terminal and issue a HTTP REST request to search about a user

## Use case - Basic Authentication

Based on the previous service created, we will define a new security policy to be able to authenticate the HTTP request using Basic authentication as the previous was too insecure.
From the service version 1.0 created, we will create a new (= clone the previous and extend the features) service and add a Basic authentication policy. The credentials will be managed
locally using a static list of users and passwords.

The steps needed to realize the use case are described hereafter

. First, we will duplicate the existing service to create a new. So, from the blog-service web page, click on the button `New Version`
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-basic.png[]
+
. Encode `2.0` as Version number and click on the butto `Create Version`
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-basic1.png[]
+
. When the screen has been refreshed. Click on the `Add policy` button which is available under the policies tab. Click on it.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-addpolicy.png[]
+
. Select `Basic Authentication Policy` within the dropdown `Policy Type` list
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-addpolicy1.png[]
+
. Add `blog-basic-auth` as Authentication Realm. Click within the checkboxes `Transport security required` and `Basic Auth required`
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-addpolicy2.png[]
+
. Choose as Identity Source, `static` within the dropdown list
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-addpolicy3.png[]
+
. Add a user and password (example : charles/demo)
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-addpolicy4.png[]
+
. Save the policy by clikcing on the `Add policy` button. Then, you will return to the service definition screen where you will publish the service.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-addpolicy5.png[]
+
. Click on the `Publish` button to publish it. 
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-published.png[]
+
NOTE: Check the url of the endpoint to be used to access the new service
+
. Issue a HTTP Request from a terminal to access the REST search service

## Use case - Oauth2 with Keycloak

The last use case that we will cover Oauth2 & Openid-connect authentication & authorization. Basically, ApiMan will be used as the platform issuing a request against the OAuth2
authorization server to verify that the token send by an application is authorized to access the REST service. For that purpose, an OpenID JSON Token will be generated by apiman and returned
to the application interested to access the real service. Based on the information provided within the token like the role, the OAuth2 platform will verify the request and determine if the
application is authorized to access the service according to the credentials provided and role.

In order to use Oauth2 with Apiman, we will first install a new plugin as the Oauth2 plugin is not installed per default. Here are the steps required to install it

. Return to the home page of the ApiMan Management Server and click on the link `Manager plugins` of the System Administration section.
+
image::images/apiman-add-oauth2-plugin.png[]
+
. Next, click on the `Add Plugin` button in order to pass the information required to install the plugin
+
image::images/apiman-add-oauth2-plugin1.png[]
+
. Fill the fields using these values and click on the `Add plugin` button when this is done
+
----
Group Id : io.apiman.plugins
Artifact ID : apiman-plugins-keycloak-oauth-policy
Version : 1.1.8.Final
----
+
. When we will return to the plugins screen, we can see that a new plugin entry has been added
+
image::images/apiman-add-oauth2-plugin2.png[]

. Setup Keycloak realm

image::images/keycloak-addrealm.png[]

. Change Direct Grant Api for the Fuse Realm

image::images/keycloak-usedirectgrantapi.png[]

. Add a client

image::images/keycloak-addclient.png[]

. Change Direct Grant Api


image::images/keycloak-switchtopublicanddirectgrant.png[]

. Add a user

image::images/keycloak-adduser.png[]

. Change password and disable to reset password

image::images/keycloak-adduser-password.png[]


. Create a new service version 3
. Duplicate the service version 2 and remove the basic authentication policy

image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2.png[]

. Add a new policy and select "Keycloak Oauth Policy"

image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2-1.png[]

. Encode the endpoint 

image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2-2.png[]

. Copy / paste the certificate that you can get from Keycloak

image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2-3.png[]

. Get Certificate

keycloak-certificate.png

. Save the policy and service

image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2-4.png[]

. Publish the service
. Run this bash script
+
[source]
----
./script/src/main/resources/oauth2-all-requests.sh
----
+
. Review metrics

image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2-5.png[]
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2-6.png[]

## Use case - Add roles

. Open keycloak, select fuse realm and add 2 roles
. Add reader role

image::images/keycloak-addrole-reader.png[]

. Add writer role 

image::images/keycloak-addrole-writer.png[]

image::images/keycloak-addroles.png[]

. Assign the roles to the user admin adn reader
.. Add reader role to the newly created read user

image::images/keycloak-addrole-reader-to-user.png[]

.. Add writer role to the admin user

image::images/keycloak-addrole-writerreader-to-admin.png[]

. Create from the previous service a new
. Add an authorization policy

image::images/apiman-authorization-policy.png[]

. Define 3 resources mapping to assign a role to a verb and a path

image::images/apiman-authorization-policy1.png[]

image::images/apiman-add-authorizationpolicy.png[]

. Use respectively these bash scripts to issue HTTP requests against the ApiMan gateway as an admin user or reader user

# Replay

If, for any reason, you would like to restart the demo from the beginning. Then, perform these steps to clean the JBoss Fuse Server

. Exit from the JBoss Fuse Console using the command `CTRL-D` or `osgi:shutdown` command
. Run this script `./bin/deletefabric8`. 
+
NOTE: It will kill the jvm instances and delete the instances and some sub-folders defined under the data folder.
. Stop the jetty web container started using the command `mvn jetty:run`

# Troubleshooting

* When the local Camel REST endpoints don't work, you can query directly the elasticsearch database using these HTTPie requests to check if it works.

# Minimal installation

You can also run the project locally using `mvn camel:run` at the condition that the Karaf feature `insight-elasticsearch` or the profile `insight-elasticsearch.datastore` if a fabric server has been deployed into the JBoss Fuse .2.

. Open a Windows or Unix terminal and move to the directory `camel-rest-dsl-demo-master/routing`
. Launch Apache Camel

    mvn camel:run

. Control that Apache Camel has been started
