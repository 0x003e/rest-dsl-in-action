= REST DSL in Action

toc::[]

== Goals

* Using the new `Rest` DSL and `Elasticsearch` component of Apache Camel, expose CRUD services for a repository of blog articles.
* Secure RESTful endpoints using `APIMan` and `Keycloak` according to different scenario : basic authentication, Oauth2 and Oauth2 & roles.
* Populate and query an Elasticsearch database using the `Elasticsearch` component of Apache Camel.
* Analyze the Elasticsearch data using `Kibana`.
* Document the RESTful endpoints using Swagger API.

== Overview

This JBoss Fuse demo will demonstrate how the new Apache Camel REST DSL syntax can be used to expose REST services.
These REST services will use to add, search or delete blog articles in an Elasticsearch database.
The use case has been enriched to also expose a file endpoint:

image::images/fuse-lab1.png[]

The file endpoint is responsible for polling a folder, consuming csv files in that folder and inserting all the articles into the database.
The Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is called from different routes and will communicate with the ElasticSearch Database to perform the CRUD operations.
The data can be visualized using a Kibana dashboard.
Swagger API will be used to document the RESTFull services.
Finally, we will secure the endpoints using Apiman & Keycloak projects using Basic authentication, Oauth2 or Oauth2 with roles.

The Elasticsearch database and the Apache Camel projects will be deployed into different Fuse Managed Containers operated by a JBoss Fuse Fabric Server.

A kibana dashboard will be used to analyze the Blog articles published into the database

The CRUD services can be accessed using the new Camel REST component by performing HTTP requests (GET/PUT/DELETE) while the file component will also allow to do a bulk insert of blog articles.

By example, to use the REST Service responsible to insert an article within the Elasticsearch database, a JSON article `{ "user": "cmoulliard" "postDate": "2015-12-12", "body": "Integration is hard.", "title": "On distributed search" }` message is issued against the REST endpoint `/blog/article/id` using a HTTP GET operation.
The content of this HTTP request will be processed by an Apache Camel route as showed hereafter and transformed in order to access the elasticsearch component to call the Elasticsearch database.

[source,java]
----
rest("/blog/").id("rest-blog-service").produces("application/json").consumes("application/json")

        .put("/article/{id}").id("rest-put-article").type(Blog.class)
            .to("direct:add");

JacksonDataFormat jacksondf = new JacksonDataFormat(Blog.class);

from("direct:add").id("add-direct-route")
        .log(LoggingLevel.INFO,"Add new Blog entry service called !")

        .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_NAME).simple("{{indexname}}")
        .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_TYPE).simple("{{indextype}}")
        .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_OPERATION).constant(ElasticsearchConfiguration.OPERATION_INDEX)

        // Transform Java Object to JSON
        .marshal(jacksondf)

        // Call the add service of the elasticsearchService POJO to generate the IndexRequest object
        .beanRef("elasticSearchService", "add")

        // Call the elasticsearch Service to add/insert an entry within the index
        .to("elasticsearch://{{clustername}}?ip={{address}}")

        // Response received and returned to the REST endpoint
        .log("Response received : ${body}");
----

The following table summaries the Routes used, REST Services exposed and the Bean Methods called like the Object type used to call the ElasticSearch database

|====
| Rest URl | Operation | Route | Bean method | ElasticSearch Class Type
| /blog/article/ | PUT | AddArticleToElasticRoute | ElasticSearchService.add() | IndexRequest
| blog/article/search/user/{user} | GET | SearchArticleToElasticRoute | ElasticSearchService.getBlog() | GetResponse
| blog/article/search/id/{id} | GET | SearchArticleToElasticRoute | ElasticSearchService.getBlogs() | SearchResponse
| blog/article/{id} | DELETE | DeleteArticleToElasticRoute | ElasticSearchService.() | DeleteRequest
|====

To do this bulk import, you will create a CSV file containing this record structure `id,user,blog description,title` that you can define several times into the file.
All the records will be uploaded by the file endpoint, transformed using the `Apache Camel Bindy` Dataformat to a collection of Blog objects.
Next, each Blog object will be used as input object to issue a request to insert a new record within the Elasticsearch database using the Bean ElasticSearch.

[source,java]
----
from("{{fileUri}}")
    .log(LoggingLevel.DEBUG,"Records received : ${body}")
    .unmarshal(csv)
    .split(body())
        .setHeader("id").simple("${body.id}")
        .to("direct:add");

JacksonDataFormat jacksondf = new JacksonDataFormat(Blog.class);

from("direct:add").id("add-direct-route")
    .log(LoggingLevel.INFO,"Add new Blog entry service called !")

    .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_NAME).simple("{{indexname}}")
    .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_INDEX_TYPE).simple("{{indextype}}")
    .setHeader(ElasticsearchConfiguration.PARAM_OPERATION).constant(ElasticsearchConfiguration.OPERATION_INDEX)

    // Transform Java Object to JSON
    .marshal(jacksondf)

    // Call the add service of the elasticsearchService POJO to generate the IndexRequest object
    .beanRef("elasticSearchService", "add")

    // Call the elasticsearch Service to add/insert an entry within the index
    .to("elasticsearch://{{clustername}}?ip={{address}}")
    .log("Response received : ${body}");

=== Compile Project

. Open a Windows or Unix terminal.
. Using the `git` utility, clone this project to your local workstation.
+
NOTE: For the purposes of these lab instructions, the directory of this cloned project on your local workstation will be referred to as: `$DEMO_DIRECTORY`.
. Change directory into: `$DEMO_DIRECTORY` and build the maven project:
+
----
cd rest-dsl-in-action
mvn clean install
----

=== Networking

Ensure that your $HOSTNAME environment variable on your workstation maps to either:

.. Your local loopback address (127.0.01) when NOT connected to a network OR
.. The ip address of the network your workstation is currently connected to (wifi, ethernet, etc).

On Unix type operating systems, these networking modifications can be made in: `/etc/hosts`.

The workstation's `hostname` is used by the following components:

. The ElasticSearch server uses the `hostname` to bind its socket server upon start up.
. The Apache Camel Elasticsearch component uses the `hostname` to access the Elasticsearch server.
. The Fuse Fabric Server uses the `hostname` to assign an IP address to the socket server of the Apache Zookeeper server.

=== Install and Run JBoss Fuse

. Download JBoss Fuse Server and unzip the archive file.
+
NOTE: For the purposes of this lab, the directory created from having unzipped the `JBoss Fuse` zip archive will be referred to as `$FUSE_HOME`.
. Edit the `etc/user.properties` file found in the home directory of `jboss-fuse-6.2.0.redhat-xxx`
+
Uncomment the line containing the `admin` user and save the file.
+
-----
admin=admin,admin,manager,viewer,Monitor, Operator, Maintainer, Deployer, Auditor, Administrator, SuperUser
-----
. Open a second Windows or Unix terminal and change directory to the root of the JBoss Fuse installation.
. Execute the following command to make all Fuse shell scripts executable:
+
-----
chmod 755 bin/*
-----
. Execute the following command to launch the JBoss Fuse Server:
+
-----
./bin/fuse
-----

=== Create a Fuse Fabric Server with 2 child containers

. Next, within the Fuse Karaf console, issue the following shell command:
+
-----
shell:source mvn:org.jboss.fuse/deployment/1.0/script/install
-----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `install` shell script contains some Fabric subshell commands responsible for setup of a Fabric server and two containers (elasticsearch-node and demo).
The first child container will be used as the Elasticsearch database server.
The second Fuse managed container is used to run the Apache Camel Routes and expose the REST and File endpoints.

=== Deploy the Fabric project into the Fabric Server

. In a terminal window, change to the `routing` directory of this project: `rest-dsl-in-action/routing`
. Execute the following command:
+
----
mvn fabric8:deploy
----
+
Doing so will deploy the `demo` project configuration into the `gpe-fuse` profile of the Fabric Server.

.. If Fuse has not been previously run on your workstation, it's likely that the following prompt will appear:
+
-----
There is no <server> section in your ~/.m2/settings.xml file for the server id: fabric8.upload.repo

You can enter the username/password now and have the settings.xml updated or you can do this by hand if you prefer.

Would you like to update the settings.xml file now? (y/n): y
Please let us know the login details for this server: fabric8.upload.repo

Username: admin
Password:
Repeat Password:

Copied original: /home/jbride/.m2/settings.xml to: /home/jbride/.m2/settings.xml.backup-1.xml
Updated settings file: /home/jbride/.m2/settings.xml
-----
+
If prompted as per above, respond with a `y` (to allow for a modification to your `~/.m2/settings.xml`) and use username / password credentials of `admin / admin`  (as per the default in `$FUSE_INSTALL/etc/user.properties`).
.. Once deployment is complete, you should see output similar to the following:

== Setup Elasticsearch Data Mapping

In order to collect the data using the ElasticSearch No SQL database, an index with a name of `blog` and type `article` needs to be created.

In addition, the properties of the new type `article` need to be defined.
To do so, the following JSON definition will be used:

----
{
  "article": {
    "properties": {
      "user": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "title": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "postDate": {
        "type": "date",
        "format": "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm"
      },
      "body": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "id": {
        "type": "integer"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

The tasks in this section of the lab will be executed by invoking the RESTful services of the `Elasticsearch` container managed by Fuse Fabric.

. In a terminal window, change directory to `$DEMO_DIRECTORY`.
. Execute the following 3 commands  using the either the `http` or `curl` utilities:
.. `http`:
+
----
http PUT http://localhost:9200/blog
http PUT http://localhost:9200/blog/_mapping/article < data/elasticsearch/mapping.json
http http://localhost:9200/blog/_mapping/article
----
.. or `curl`:
+
----
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/blog
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/blog/_mapping/article -d @data/elasticsearch/mapping.json
curl http://localhost:9200/blog/_mapping/article
----
+
NOTE: The first command creates the index and the second command defines the properties of the new type `article`.
The third command confirms that the mapping between the `article` type and its properties have been created.

== Kibana dashboard and services

The data inserted into the Elasticsearch Database can be analyzed using the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana[Kibana] dashboard.
The dashboard is designed around modern HTML5 Web technologies and can be run locally with a Web Container.

This demo provides a maven goal that launches Kibana embedded in a `Jetty` HTTP Server.
Kibana can then be accessed from a browser at the following address: `http://localhost:9090/kibana3/index.html`

=== Start Kibana
. To start Kibana in your local workstation, open a terminal window and change to the `$DEMO_DIRECTORY/kibana` directory.
. Execute the following maven command: `mvn jetty:run`
+
----
mvn jetty:run

. Once the server is launched, open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:9090/kibana3/index.html`.
+
NOTE: The first time connecting to the Dashboard, the index HTML page will display general content about the kibana project, how to setup a dashboard and how to import data from an Elasticsearch Database.
+
image::images/dashboard1.png[]

=== Load project dashboard

A Kibana dashboard has been created and is provided in this project.
This dashboard is already configured with `histogram` and `list` panels.

The dashboard included in this project needs to be loaded into the Elasticsearch HTTP server.
This can be done via the `kibana-int` REST service running in JBoss Fuse.

. In a terminal window, change to the `$LAB_ASSETS` directory.
. Execute one of the following commands to post the new dashboard to the Elasticsearch HTTP server:
.. `http` utility:
+
----
http PUT http://localhost:9200/kibana-int/dashboard/fusedemo < data/elasticsearch/dashboard.json
----
.. `curl` utility:
+
----
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/kibana-int/dashboard/fusedemo -d @data/elasticsearch/dashboard.json
----

. To view the new dashboard, refresh `Kibana` home page within your browser and select the `load` button from the top menu bar:
+
image::images/dashboard2.png[]
+
. Select the `fuse-demo` dashboard:
+
image::images/dashboard3.png[]
+
Currently, the `fuse-demo` dashboard contains panels without any data as we haven't yet populated the database with records.

=== Add and modify blog data
This section of the lab provides instructions on how to add a new blog and modify data maintained in Elasticsearch and exposed through Kibana.
The commands in this section of the lab invoke RESTful camel services (exposed via port 9191) running in a Fuse container managed by Fabric.

. In an open terminal window, change directory to `$DEMO_DIRECTORY`.
. Add a blog
.. Issue one of the following HTTP requests using either the `http` or `curl` utilities:
+
----
http PUT http://localhost:9191/blog/article < data/elasticsearch/entry.json
----
+
----
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9191/blog/article -d @data/elasticsearch/entry.json
----
+
NOTE: Before issuing the HTTP GET request, the content of the blog article can be modified by editing the file: `data/elasticserch/entry.json`

. Search the user `cmoulliard`
+
----
http http://localhost:9191/blog/article/search/user/cmoulliard
----
+
----
curl http://localhost:9191/blog/article/search/user/cmoulliard
----

. Search the user which has been encoded with the id `0`
+
----
http http://localhost:9191/blog/article/search/id/0
----
+
----
curl http://localhost:9191/blog/article/search/id/0
----

. Delete a user.
+
----
http DELETE http://localhost:9191/blog/article/0
----
+
----
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9191/blog/article/0
----

== Bulk import

In order to perform a buk import of articles within the ElasticSearch database, copy/paste the records.csv file from the `$DEMO_DIRECTORY/camel/src/data` directory to the `articles` directory created under the local instance `demo`.

. Create the `FUSE_HOME` ENV variable to point to the home directory of the installation directory of JBoss Fuse

    export FUSE_HOME=/Users/chmoulli/Fuse/Fuse-servers/jboss-fuse-6.2.0.redhat-133

. Create the `DEMO_DIRECTORY` ENV variable to point to the folder containing the demo project

    export DEMO_DIRECTORY=/Users/chmoulli/Downloads/rest-dsl-in-action

. Copy the file
+
----
cp $DEMO_DIRECTORY/routing/src/data/articles/records.csv $FUSE_HOME/instances/demo/articles/

= Swagger documentation (optional)

For the purpose of this demo, we have documented the REST Services using the http://swagger.io/[Swagger API]. The documentation is defined within the `swagger/srcmain/resources/services.json` file of the swagger maven module.
The file has been produced manually as camel-swagger component 2.15 packaged within JBoss Fuse 6.2 doesn't parse yet the REST DSL syntax to generate it. This feature should be available
for the next release of JBoss Fuse.

To access the documentation and run the queries against the service, here are the instruction to follow

. Open a terminal within the `swagger` maven module

    cd swagger

. Launch the script +./run_jetty.sh+ to build the project locally and start a jetty instance with Swagger UI

    ./run_jetty.sh

. When the jetty instance is started, open your browser at this address

   http://localhost:8000/?url=services.json

. You can now add a user by clicking on the service `Add a new Blog Article`.
. To select the user data, just click on the Model schema and the field (left part of the service `Add a new Blog Article` will be populated.
. Change the data to be used
+
----
{
  "id": "21",
  "user": "cmoulliard",
  "body": "This is a blog article",
  "title": "Title of the blog article",
  "postDate": "2015-10-03T10:10"
}
----
. Click on `try it out!` button
+
image::images/swagger1.png[]
+
. Search for a user using the service `Blog Search Id operation` and fill the parameter with the id `21`
+
image::images/swagger2.png[]
+
. Review the results using the `Kibana` dashboard and search for the id which is equal to `21`
+

= Security governance with Apiman & Keycloak

During the first part of the demo, we have deployed the Apache Camel Routes exposing the REST services to create, search or delete a user into a JBoss Fuse Karaf container
and installed also an Elasticsearch server to collect the data from the different REST Services. Now, within the next section of the demo, we will
use the ApiMan & Keycloak projects to secure our endpoints in order to authenticate the incoming HTTP request using Basic Authentication but also OAuth2 to authorize the access
to the service based on the role provided.

The instructions required to install the server and to configure them are described hereafter :

. Download [WildFly](http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/8.2.0.Final/wildfly-8.2.0.Final.zip) & [Apiman 1.1.7.Final overlay for WildFly 8.2](http://downloads.jboss.org/apiman/1.1.7.Final/apiman-distro-wildfly8-1.1.7.Final-overlay.zip)
. Unpack the `WildFly 8.2 zip`
. Unpack the`apiman 1.1.7.Final WildFly 8 overlay zip` inside the wildfly directory
. Start WildFly 8 using the `standalone-apiman.xml` configuration file
. Point your browser at the apiman UI and login using `admin` as user and `admin123!` as password
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use this list of instructions to download and install Apiman locally

----
mkdir ~/apiman-1.1.7.Final
cd ~/apiman-1.1.7.Final
curl http://downloads.jboss.org/wildfly/8.2.0.Final/wildfly-8.2.0.Final.zip -o wildfly-8.2.0.Final.zip
curl http://downloads.jboss.org/apiman/1.1.7.Final/apiman-distro-wildfly8-1.1.7.Final-overlay.zip -o apiman-distro-wildfly8-1.1.7.Final-overlay.zip
unzip wildfly-8.2.0.Final.zip
unzip -o apiman-distro-wildfly8-1.1.7.Final-overlay.zip -d wildfly-8.2.0.Final
cd wildfly-8.2.0.Final
./bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-apiman.xml
----
====

Now that our Apiman server has been launched, we will create an organization to manage the different services that we would like to secure using the following security policies; Basic Authentication, OAuth & Limit rates.

. Open your web browser at this address `http://localhost:8080/apimanui/` and encode `admin` for the username and `admin123!` as password to access the application.
+
image::images/apiman-login.png[]
+
. If the authentication succeeds, then you will be redirected to the `Api Management screen`
+
image::images/apiman-management.png[]
+
. Click on the link Create a New Organization` and encode `Fuse` as organization name within the field `Organization Name` of the new screen displayed.
. Next, click on the `Create Organisation` button.
+
image::images/apiman-organization.png[]
+
. The Web UI is refreshed and a new organization called `Fuse` is displayed under the `Home` screen
+
image::images/apiman-fuse-organisation.png[]
+
. Click on the `Service` Tab of the `Fuse` organization to register the REST Service that we will manage
+
NOTE: As we will not define different SLA (e.g. quotas, ...) to manage the service, No http://www.apiman.io/latest/user-guide.html=_plans[plan] will be defined for the demo
+
image::images/apiman-fuse-organisation-service.png[]

== Use case - Direct forward

The first use case that we will deal with is very simple and can be compared to a proxy forwarding scenario where the incoming request is matched to a service
and next forwarded to the real endpoint exposing the REST service. To design it, we will create a service, specify the address of the service and publish the service in order to let APiMan Gateway to
accept the HTTP requests.

. Click on the button `New Service` of this screen.
. Within `New Service` screen, add `blog-service` as Service Name and provide a `description` to mention that this service
  is not secured "Insecure service. No authentication will be required to access the service". When done, click on the Create Service` button
+
image::images/apiman-fuse-organisation-addservice.png[]
+
. You will be redirected to the `blog-service`, version `1.0` screen where we will add the URL of the REST Service exposed by the Apache Camel REST DSL
  and specify that the service is http://www.apiman.io/latest/user-guide.html=_services[public].
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice.png[]
+
. Click on the `implementation` link and add the Api endpoint `http://localhost:9191/blog/article`, select `REST` from the `Api Type` dropdown box. The API endpoint corresponds to our REST Service path as defined within the REST DSL `blog/article`.
. Click on the `Save` button
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-api.png[]
+
. From the `blog-service` screen, select the `Plans` and click within the checkbox `Make this service public` as we haven't defined any plans.
. Save the service definition by clicking again on the `save` button.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-plans.png[]
+
. Our service is ready and we will publish it.
+
NOTE: When a service is published, then the Api endpoint will become available and the Api Gateway will be able to process HTTP requests addressed to this service.
+
. Click on the `Publish` button of the `blog-service` screen.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-publish.png[]
+
NOTE: The screen is refreshed and additional information appears under the list like `Contracts, Endpoint, Activity, Metrics`
+
. Click on `Endpoint` to see the URL address of the endpoint exposed by the Api Gateway and select it
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-unsecure-endpoint.png[]
+
. Use one of the existing opened terminal and issue a HTTP REST request to search about a user

== Use case - Basic Authentication

Based on the previous service created, we will define a new security policy to be able to authenticate the HTTP request using Basic authentication as the previous was too insecure.
From the service version 1.0 created, we will create a new (= clone the previous and extend the features) service and add a Basic authentication policy. The credentials will be managed
locally using a static list of users and passwords.

The steps needed to realize the use case are described hereafter

. First, we will duplicate the existing service to create a new. So, from the blog-service web page, click on the button `New Version`
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-basic.png[]
+
. Encode `2.0` as Version number and click on the butto `Create Version`
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-basic1.png[]
+
. When the screen has been refreshed. Click on the `Add policy` button which is available under the policies tab. Click on it.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-addpolicy.png[]
+
. Select `Basic Authentication Policy` within the dropdown `Policy Type` list
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-addpolicy1.png[]
+
. Add `blog-basic-auth` as Authentication Realm. Click within the checkboxes `Transport security required` and `Basic Auth required`
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-addpolicy2.png[]
+
. Choose as Identity Source, `static` within the dropdown list
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-addpolicy3.png[]
+
. Add a user and password (example : charles/demo)
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-addpolicy4.png[]
+
. Save the policy by clikcing on the `Add policy` button. Then, you will return to the service definition screen where you will publish the service.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-addpolicy5.png[]
+
. Click on the `Publish` button to publish it.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-published.png[]
+
NOTE: Check the url of the endpoint to be used to access the new service
+
. Issue a HTTP Request from a terminal to access the REST search service
+

== Use case - Oauth2 with Keycloak

The last use case that we will cover Oauth2 & Openid-connect authentication & authorization. Basically, ApiMan will be used as the platform issuing a request against the OAuth2
authorization server to verify that the token send by an application is authorized to access the REST service. For that purpose, an OpenID JSON Token will be generated by apiman and returned
to the application interested to access the real service. Based on the information provided within the token like the role, the OAuth2 platform will verify the request and determine if the
application is authorized to access the service according to the credentials provided and role.

In order to use Oauth2 with Apiman, we will first install a new plugin as the Oauth2 plugin is not installed per default. Here are the steps required to install it

. Return to the home page of the ApiMan Management Server and click on the link `Manager plugins` of the System Administration section.
+
image::images/apiman-add-oauth2-plugin.png[]
+
. Next, click on the `Add Plugin` button in order to pass the information required to install the plugin
+
image::images/apiman-add-oauth2-plugin1.png[]
+
. Fill the fields using these values and click on the`Add plugin` button when this is done
+
----
Group Id : io.apiman.plugins
Artifact ID : apiman-plugins-keycloak-oauth-policy
Version : 1.1.8.Final
----
+
. When we will return to the plugins screen, we can see that a new plugin entry has been added
+
image::images/apiman-add-oauth2-plugin2.png[]

Like we have done for the basic authentication with Apiman, we will first create a realm that the OAuth2 server will use to manage the credentials, the roles and the applications authorized to access
the service. To achieve this goal, we will first configure Keycloak which is the Oauth2 server used by Apiman behind the scene to authorize the applications.

. First, log on to the KeyCloak server usign the username `admin` and password `admin123!` at this address `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin`
. If the authentication succeeds, then you will access the Management console from where we will create a new Realm
. Click on the button `add Realm` which is displayed at the top part of the screen
+
image::images/keycloak-addrealm.png[]
+
. Next add `Fuse` as name within the screen `Add Realm` and save the result by clicking on the `save` button
+
image::images/keycloak-addrealm1.png[]
+
. From the settings Fuse screen, select (if not yet done) the `Direct Grant Api` by clicking on the `on/off` button that we have within the `Login` tab and save the action done.
+
image::images/keycloak-usedirectgrantapi.png[]
+
. Next, we will define the application which is a client which is authorized to access the fuse realm. So click on the tab `Clients` and click on the button `Create`
+
image::images/keycloak-addclient.png[]
+
. Add within the fied `Client ID`, `fuse` as name of the application that we will authorize
+
. Change next `Direct Grant Api` by clicking on the `on/off` button. This step is required to allow REST Apiman to use the REST APi to access the Realm managed by the Oauth2 server. The `Client Protocol` that we will use is `openid-connect` and the access type is `public`.
 Save the result by clicking on the button `Save`.
+
image::images/keycloak-switchtopublicanddirectgrant.png[]

. As an application (or client) will be authenticated by the Oauth2 Server, we will now define an `admin` user and setup its password to access the platform. So, select the tab `Users` and click
  on the `Add user` button
+
image::images/keycloak-adduser.png[]
+
. Fill the fields `Username` and `First Name` with the value `admin` and save the modifications done by clicking on the `Save` button
. As the platform generates a password, we will change it to use our own password. So, click on the `Credentials` tab and encode the `admin` password within the fields
  `New password` and `Password confirmation`. Disable the option `Temporary` by clicking on the `on/off` button
+
image::images/keycloak-adduser-password.png[]

We have finished to create the REALM within Keycloak Server as also the client ID auhorized to access the platform and finally we have define a admin user like its password. The next
step will consist to create a new version fo the service like we did for the Basic authentication but now using Oauth Policy.
So, from the home page of the Apiman Management Console, seclect the service version 2.0 of `Blog-service`

. Duplicate the service `version 2` by clicking on the button `New Version` and when the screen is refreshed, seclect `Policies` tab to remove the basic authentication policy defined
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2.png[]
+
. Add a new policy by clicking on the button `Add policy`. When the screen `Add policy` appears, select `Keycloak Oauth Policy` within the dropdown list of the policy type.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2-1.png[]

. Encode the endpoint of the REST api which is authorized to access the Oauth2 Server to request a Oauth2 Token. So, fill the field `Realm` with this url `http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/fuse`
  and add to the field `Keycloak Realm Certificate` the certificate which has been generated for the `Fuse` realm. The certificate can be retrieved from the Oauth2 Server as explained just after.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2-2.png[]
+
. Copy / paste the certificate that you can get from the Keycloak server (`http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/fuse/keys-settings`) under the screen `Settings`, `Keys` tab
+
image::images/keycloak-certificate.png[]
+
. Finally, select `true` as the value of the field Forward Realm Roles` to send to the application, the roles defined within the realm. They will be used within the last use cases to control if the application
  calling the Oauth2 server is authorized according to its role to use a specific service.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2-3.png[]
+
. Save the policy and the service version `3.0`.
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2-4.png[]
+
. Publish the service like we have done before
. When the service has been published, you will use a bash script responsible to call the OAuth2 server to get a token that next the application will use to issue the CRUD requests against the Api Gateway

. When the ApiMan gateway will receive the HTTP requests, it will log the information (Number of requests, number of responses / type) into a local ElasticsSearch database. The `Metrics` tab that
  we have / service can allow us to check these data.
. You can view the responses / usage using the`Show` dropdown list and filter the services for the last hour, days ...
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2-5.png[]
+
. Or Select `Response Type` to see the details according to the status (successfull, fail, error)
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-newservice-oauth2-6.png[]

== Use case - Add roles

To be exhaustive, we will now extend the OAuth2 Fuse Realm to specify 2 roles (writer/reader) to restrict the access to the service according to them. Typically, we will create the writer role to let a
user to PUT or DELETE a blog article while a reader role will only allow the users to query the REST services.

. Open your web browser at this address to open the Oauth2 server `http:/localhost:8080/auth/admin`
. Select the `fuse` realm and add 2 roles by clicking on the tab `Roles`
. Click on the button `Add Role` and fill the field `Role name` with the `reader` value
. Save the role by clicking on the button `Save`
+
image::images/keycloak-addrole-reader.png[]
+
. Repeat the operation to create a `writer` role
+
image::images/keycloak-addrole-writer.png[]
+
. When you return to the `Roles` screen, a table will display the 2 roles created
+
image::images/keycloak-addroles.png[]
+
. Now, we will assign the roles to their respective users. So, let's say that the `admin` user can has the `writer` and `reader` roles while a lambda user will only be able to use the `reader` role
. Create a new user as we did previously using as name `reader` and password `reader`. Don't forget to disable the temporary option.
. Save it and select the `Role Mappings` tab to assign the `reader` role
+
image::images/keycloak-addrole-reader-to-user.png[]
+
. Assign the roles `writer` and `reader` to the admin user
+
image::images/keycloak-addrole-writerreader-to-admin.png[]
+
. We can leaver the OAuth2 server platform and return to Apiman in order to create a new service - version 4.0
+
NOTE: Clone the Service - version 3.0 and specify 4.0 as the vesion name of this service
+
. Add a new policy by clicking on the button `Policy`. Within the dropdown list, select the value `Authorization Policy`
+
image::images/apiman-authorization-policy.png[]
+
. We will now define 3 rules to map a path to a REST verb (which corresponds to the HTTP operation) and a role by using the `Add Authorization Rule` section of the screen. Encode the information as defined within the following table
+
|===
|Path | Verb | Role required
| .* | PUT | Writer
| .* | DELETE | Writer
| .* | GET | Reader
|===
+
image::images/apiman-authorization-policy1.png[]
+
. Save the result by clicking on the button `Update Policy`
. Publish the service version 4.0
+
image::images/apiman-add-authorizationpolicy.png[]
+
. Use respectively these bash scripts to issue HTTP requests against the ApiMan gateway but using a different username (admin or reader)

+
[source]
----
./script/src/main/resources/oauth2-role-reader.sh
./script/src/main/resources/oauth2-role-writer.sh
----
+
. Verify the metrics
+
image::images/apiman-blogservice-oauth2-metrics.png[]
+
NOTE: You can also change the login/password to test if it works or create new users within the Oauth2 Server.
+
NOTE : The content of the JSon Web token replied to the application can be visualized using this web server - http://jwt.io/. Click on the Debugger link and add within the field the content of the token displayed in the terminal by the bash script
+
image::images/jwt1.png[]

Hip hip hourra, you have finished !!!

= Replay

If, for any reason, you would like to restart the demo from the beginning. Then, perform these steps to clean the JBoss Fuse Server

. Exit from the JBoss Fuse Console using the command `CTRL-D` or `osgi:shutdown` command
. Run this script `./bin/deletefabric8`.
+
NOTE: It will kill the jvm instances and delete the instances and some sub-folders defined under the data folder.
. Stop the jetty web container started using the command `mvn jetty:run`

= Troubleshooting

* When the local Camel REST endpoints don't work, you can query directly the elasticsearch database using these HTTPie requests to check if it works.
+
WARNING : The hostname must be changed depending if you run locally or remotely the JBoss Fuse Server

= Minimal installation

You can also run the project locally using `mvn camel:run` at the condition that the Karaf feature `insight-elasticsearch` or the profile `insight-elasticsearch.datastore` has been deployed into JBoss Fuse 6.2.

. Open a Windows or Unix terminal and move to the directory `rest-dsl-in-action-master/routing`
. Launch Apache Camel

    mvn camel:run

. Control that Apache Camel has been started

NOTE : Additional parameters could be defined for the elasticsearch database using the `io.fabric8.elasticsearch-insight.cfg` config file deployed into the `etc` folder of JBoss Fuse.
That should also work if you deploy locally an Elasticsearch instance on your machine but this use case hasn't been tested.

= CRUD requests - all in

When you would like test your project and if the Elasticsearch server is running locally, you can copy/paste this list of HTTPie queries to play with the CRUD scenario
It will delete the blog index, create a new index, insert articles, search using a user name or id and will delete
a user.
